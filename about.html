        <p>Jana Stoneman has always been drawn to color and how it can change just about everything. An outfit, the feel of a newly painted room, even the mood ring on your finger. Fast forward to today, and her designs are proof of that belief and one way of providing a great user experience on the web. From simple updates to steering full website redesigns, becoming a Web Content Developer was what she refers to as an LC (Life Changer).</p>
        <p> Finding little ways to connect users to the heart of the story and brand is her ultimate goal and putting the fun back into functionality. As a true believer in the phrase “Why Not?”, Jana can find solutions to boring webpages, all while keeping it accessible, simple, and a delight to use.</p>
